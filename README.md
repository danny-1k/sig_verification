# Signature Verification

Signature forgery identitfication using Siamese classifier

The network was trained on a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/robinreni/signature-verification-dataset">kaggle signature forgery identification dataset</a>

# Testing

```python app.py```

NOTE: the images you put in should have stable lightening so the preprocessing works on the image


TODO: process images with line detection to figure out the writing and reduce noise.
